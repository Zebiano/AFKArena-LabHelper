## Explaination

From **CyberMageIL**:

> Root access is a must, then you'll need a good file explorer, like Total Commander.
> The main internal folder for the game is in root:

> You'll have plenty of folders there, but the main one you'll want for asset mining is `Files`.
> There, you'll see folder/s with the current game version/s, like these:

> Usually, you'll see more than one version folder if the base app hasn't been updated in the play store to match the current game version.
> You can look in both version folders, but generally you'll find the bulk of the files in the current version.
> Either way, inside a version folder you'll see two relevant folders, `Patch` and `Timely`:
> 
> As far as I understand it, the `Patch` one is for the base files that gets downloaded in addition to the APK files when the game is first launched or when a patch is downloaded.
> `Timely` is mostly for additional files that are downloaded on the fly when accessing certain areas of the game, kinda to save bandwidth and time for stuff that's not needed immediately.
> So both are relevant for updated files.
> Anyway, in each, you enter the "Res" folder and then the "UI" folder, that's where most of the non-encrypted files are.
> As for the Maze's debuff icons, they're in `item_icon\heirloom`.
> Note that you need to access the maze in-game when the cycle is reset to get the game to download them.
